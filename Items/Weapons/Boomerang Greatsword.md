The bastardization of a gnomish weapon and an orc's need to throw huge weapons, this massive boomerang was created in the style of a greatsword. With a large, enclosed, handle on one end, no cross guard, and it's ability to sever heads at a range of 30ft it's easily the most abnormal weapon combination seen so far.
