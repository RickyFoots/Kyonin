- **Item Type**: Wondrous living item
- **Rarity**: Rare
- **Requires Attunement**: No

**Abilities**: While the "equipped" creature is conscious they're able to cast the [Telepathy](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:telepathy) spell at will, but only to connect with a given Letter, that they've contacted before, or [[Planet/Golarion/Groups/Organizations/The Turrim Infnitum/The Librarian]].
- If the disk is "mastered", beating a DC 20 CON Saving throw, by the "equipped" creature, then they will be able to connect with any and every creature currently connected to [[Planet/Golarion/Groups/Organizations/The Turrim Infnitum/The Librarian]].
