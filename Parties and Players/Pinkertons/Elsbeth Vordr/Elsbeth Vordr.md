# History 
---

- Elsbeth was born in the Kingdom of Solaris to mother [[Adalia Vordr]] and father [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/The Republic of Solaris/People of Solaris/Vassar Vordr]]

- Her father, who was born in poverty, was an intelligent man that showed promise as a leader, but due to education in the kingdom being an opportunity afforded only to the wealthy, the nobility, and those of the [[Holy Order]], he did not get a formal education and training until he married Adalia. Before he met her, he took up odd jobs here and there, before finally settling in as a janitor at the local college, learning what he could through self-study, listening in on classes he had no business being in, and reading the leftover notes written on the chalkboards of the classrooms he had to clean.

- [[Adalia Vordr]] née Misericordia was one of the three children of the noble [[Family of Misericordia]]. While undergoing her formal education at the college, she befriended Vassar there, who at the time was working as part of the cleaning staff. Gradually, they grew closer, and eventually, they wed, much to the chagrin of her family, who preferred that she marry someone who was also part of the nobility. Her family disowned her, but Adalia, a renowned scholar in her own right, was able to maintain her status in society. She recognized her husband’s potential, and through her wealth and connections, was able to provide him with an opportunity to obtain formal schooling.

- Vassar excelled in laws and politics, and soon after finishing his formal schooling, began climbing up the ranks of diplomacy. It was not long before he became a part of the King’s circle of trusted advisors, and eventually became the King’s own right-hand man and his most senior advisor. Adalia, more gifted and interested in the sciences and their relationship with magic, became a professor and researcher at the university she used to attend.

- Elsbeth never met her mother, as she sadly died in childbirth. It was rumored that Vassar, in his grief, had holed himself up in her mother’s home office for weeks, refusing to speak to anybody except the caretaker he had hired for his daughter. Vassar, after some time, was able to work through his grief and took care of his daughter as a single father. Busy with being a high-ranking official, Vassar would often take his daughter to the castle, where she would be seen by her private tutor, [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/The Republic of Solaris/People of Solaris/Paul Grimsby]], in the library. As busy as he was, though, Vassar always tried to make time for his daughter, who he truly loved and cared for. He always said she reminded him of her mother, as she had most of her mother’s facial features, but that she had his biting wit.

- Two years after Elsbeth was born, the King and Queen had their own daughter, [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/The Republic of Solaris/People of Solaris/Princess Ilfselhmina]]. Elsbeth and the princess grew up together and became the best of friends, often causing ruckus in the castle. 

- When the princess was sixteen, her father fell ill with [[Bloodfire]] and died within the year. In the interim, the Queen Consort became a figurehead, her position lacking any real power that her husband had had. Instead, that power fell to the lead advisor, Vassar, who worked mostly behind the scenes. The princess began working more closely with Vassar and the King’s former circle of advisors in preparation for when she would take the throne on her 18th birthday. Elsbeth, having discovered her own growing romantic feelings for the princess, swore to herself that she would protect the princess and her throne no matter what, and with the princess’ blessing, became a squire. Training with [[The Knights of Solaris]], Elsbeth showed great potential, to the pride of her father, who always wanted her to uphold the family name.

- The day before the princess’ coronation, a coup broke out, with most of the knights turning against the future monarch. [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/The Republic of Solaris/The Republic of Solaris]] was soon established, with Vassar as the head of the new government. Elsbeth found out soon enough that her father was the very person who initiated the coup and immediately went into hiding, despite her father’s pleas for her to stay with him and be the next ruler of the nation.

- It was unknown what happened to the princess.

- Elsbeth joined the underground resistance movement against the new government, and continued working with them for about three years until rumors started popping up that the princess was alive and was spotted outside the Kingdom. She decided to pack what little she owned and see if she could find her old friend, the princess.
