- [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/People of Kodor/Dennis Bittlesby]], and [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/People of Kodor/Sawdust]] run a **small lumber mill** together a few miles outside [[Kyonin/Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/Kodor]]. 
	- They were very loving and supportive of *Hawthorne* and used money they were saving to *upgrade/renovate* the mill to put Hawthorne through **Bard College**. 

- Member of [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/Locations/C.C.E.]] as the "*The Face*" and was trained directly by the headliner [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/People of Kodor/Kayden Fabrianno]] to be his replacement once he retired. 
	- One day a heckler in the stands made him question himself and his abilities, so he ran away and has deemed himself an adventurer and set off for adventure. 
	- Unfortunately for him, he didn't get far and began to drink himself into feeling better, in doing so, successfully failed to save a lady, [[Jolene-Pix]], from being hit on, and somehow found himself in [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/Locations/Kodor Central Prison]] with, [[Jolene-Pix]], and [[Claire Clover]].
