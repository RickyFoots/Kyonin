**Mother of All Witches**

- An extraordinarily powerful mage and [[Archfey]]. 
- Some described her as the most powerful female mage ever known, a sorceress with a reputation for passing throughout the planes. 
- In doing so, her magical hut also appeared elsewhere, and was reported to have arrived on [[Kyonin]]

#### Description
---
- The 5‑foot-tall (1.5‑meter) sorceress was said to be of godlike intelligence, but very physically ugly. 
- She had a long warty nose, a skeletal frame, and thin white hair. 
- She had sharp, iron-like teeth and fingers that curved into claws. 
- On occasion she had a rather plump frame. 
	- It was uncertain whether her changing frame was due to having recently eaten or simply on a whim of preference.
