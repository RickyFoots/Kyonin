- The second layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. 
- It was almost entirely covered by the city of the same name that stood in a valley surrounded by a ring of spiked mountains. 
- As far as most visitors and inhabitants were concerned, the layer and the city were indistinguishable.

1. Despite being potentially infinite, the city of Dis always felt crowded and oppressive to anyone inside.
2. The entire city was made of red-hot iron. 
3. Every wall and cobblestone burned to the touch. 
4. The material exuded a column of smoke that constantly shrouded the layer in a dark haze.
5. Someone who managed to leave the city could walk away from it, leaving it behind as its valley lay hidden by a ring of mountains. 
6. However, very few accounts of the city's exterior were known.
7. On the other hand, approaching Dis felt like a break from reality. 
8. A traveler could only arrive at the city by following a road paved with skulls. 
9. As the walls approached, one was, without noticing a transition, suddenly inside the city, with no edge or outer wall in sight.
