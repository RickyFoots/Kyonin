**King of Greed**

- The lord of [[-Minauros]], and potentially the richest being in existence. 
- Both literally and figuratively two-faced, the [[Archdevil]] viscount was a feckless miser whose only loyalty was to coin.

#### Description
---
- Mammon's natural appearance was eventually changed into one resembling certain yuan-ti halfbloods, albeit *30 ft (9.1 m) long*. 
- His lower half was that of an enormous, spotted serpent with yellow-brown skin comparable to swirled vomit, while his upper half sported a muscular humanoid torso with bony spines protruding across his shoulders and along his large arms.
- His horned, hairless head was similarly humanoid but seemed over-sized. 
- Some said his eyes were yellow and slitted like a snake, while others reported that his eyes were pale and pupil-less, although his vision seemed nonetheless sharp. 
- Below his white eyes were hideous black lips, behind which laid his pointed teeth, two serpentine fangs, and a forked tongue that gave him his hissing, whispering voice.
