- The third layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. 
- Ruled by the archdevil [[Mammon]], it was the economic center of the Nine Hells, where new souls were processed and minted, its great wealth belied by its ramshackle appearance and unenjoyed by the vast majority. 
- It was a wretched fen of toxic influence that promised only sickness and despair, slowly pulling everything beneath the putrid mud.

1. Minauros was best described as a great stinking swamp, a fetid marsh of mire, muck and misery extending further than one could possibly imagine. 
2. The plane was a dismal morass of reeking, rotting earth and inches of polluted, diseased water where the corrupting powers of poison and illness were enhanced and recovery diminshed. 
3. Corpses and carrion were so ubiquitous across the hellish bog that stumbling was a constant problem, and the occassional falls they induced might be enough to kill from landing on a sharp, upthrust bone or falling unconscious and drowning in the unclean waters.
4. Much of Minauros was dominated by a dreary urban landscape, a kingdom in a state of endless disrepair constantly teetering on the edge of ruin. 
5. The structures that interspered the plane were in need of constant fixing, upkeep, or outright replacement, all characterized by flimsy materials, cheap construction techniques, and shoddy artisanship. 
6. There were cities of ornately carved stone, masoned in cyclopean fashion, but even these suffered from slow decline. 
7. Almost everything built in Minauros was left untended to inexorably slide into the bottomless mud, gradually collapsing into the gigantic sinkhole that was the plane. 
8. Nothing of value stayed in the bog for long, with any treasure of size, magic, or other notability fated to be destroyed or taken.
