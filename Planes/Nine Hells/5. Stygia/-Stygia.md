- The fifth layer of the Nine Hells of Baator. 
- A vast frozen sea dominated by ice floes and icebergs.
- It was named after the River Styx, which crisscrossed its entire extent.
 
---
1. Stygia was a vast ocean of saltwater that was almost completely frozen. 
2. Its surface was almost entirely covered in ice floes and icebergs that crowded and completely covered the ocean. 
3. The only open body of water was the Styx, which kept its dark, oily water separated from the saltwater and meandered through the layer as if it were crossing a plain.
4. Some of the ice floes were large enough to support cities. 
5. Navigation between settlements was made relatively easy by the presence of the Styx. 
6. Small arctic plants grew in some locations, creating vast icy swamps that were slightly warmer than the rest of the layer. 
7. Those areas attracted several creatures and wildlife, but were at a larger risk of the thinner ice breaking.
8. The sky of Stygia was in a state of perpetual twilight and was constantly struck by lightning, which made it extremely dangerous for flying creatures. 
9. Thunder swept the land in a continuous rumble.
10. Stygia was unique among the layers of Baator in that it was almost entirely untamed and wild, with no significant part of its territory devoted to any particular purpose. 
11. For that reason, its wilderness was inhabited by several aggressive creatures such as dire wolves, frost worms, krakens, mammoths, polar bears, sharks, and remorhazes, which were used as practice for devils in military training.
