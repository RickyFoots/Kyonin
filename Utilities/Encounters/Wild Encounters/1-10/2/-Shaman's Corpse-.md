# Perception 
---
- **1-8** = In the center of it all is the corpse of an *orcish shaman*, pierced by arrows and adorned with orcish sigils carved across his body.
- **9-14** = An assortment of bodies are found within the roots, all different races, but all of them are wearing the same symbols on the armor and clothes.
	- ***General Intelligence***: **10-Above** = The symbol is that of a modified [[Mystra - Magic]] symbol 
		- [[Planet/Golarion/Groups/Cults/Servants of the Weave/Servants of the Weave]] symbol = An eight point star with *large ring running through each of the stars points*, with different **magical symbols** around the ring, and the *symbol of Earth* at it's center. 
- **15-Above** = There is glowing and rippling "metal" polyhedron in the hands of the shaman.
	- [[Heart of the Weave]] 

# Nature/Arcana

- **1-10** = Some horrible magic, that is a blight to both nature and the gods was cast at the center of this crater. 
- **11-Above** = The magic that was used here was somehow both godly and mortal-made in nature, it's as if someone has stolen the magic from a god and perverted it to serve their own ends.
