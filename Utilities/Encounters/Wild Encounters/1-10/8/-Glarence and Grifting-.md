- As the party moves along their path they'll come across a rough looking wooden box with the word *Lucky Me* written poorly across the front of the box with some kind of smashed berry or bug and a Kobold man named [[Glarence]] dressed in some scavenged dress clothes that appear to be way to big for him.
	- He offers to double all the gold the party puts up to play against him.
 
- If the players successfully discover Glarence is cheating them and confront him about it, he'll simply give the gold back
- If they threaten or try to rob him he'll jump down a small hole hidden behind him and escape to his "Bugs Bunny-esque" house underground.
