- As the party is trekking through the wilderness they'll discover a group of [[Towns Guard]] that have been knocked unconscious, <u>not dead</u>, and had all of their armor and Items removed.

- Upon deaths, _Guron_ will have his warriors take the weapons of the fallen and repair them, also adding bits and pieces of metal on it to make it more fitting for battle with humans. 
	- Once his troops are outfitted with new weapons, they move deeper into the forest to assault the nearest village or trading caravan.

# Trigger
---
- *Passive Perception* = **18** - Goblins stealth, sneaking up on the party.
	- If the party doesn't see the [[Goblin]]s sneaking up on them then (*2d6+3*) goblins and [[Guron Green Tooth]] will pounce on the party and gain a **Surprise Round** on the party.
	
# Persuasion
---
- **1-10** = The Goblins/Guron go along with what the party wants but plan to stab them in the back and will get a **Surprise Round** on the party.
- **11-15** = The Goblins/Guron won't attack the party and are willing to trade with them.
	- They have an assortment of various metal ingots and alloy's as well as some "*Gobofied*" versions of weapons. 
- **16-Above** = The Goblins/Guron are willing to listen to the party and Guron is willing to make the party a weapon.
	- The party doesn't get to choose the weapon and Guron will send someone from his tribe to the party using a *Sending Stone* 

# Intimidation
---
- **1-5** = The Goblins/Guron laugh at the party and attack, but they will get advantage on their first attacks on the party.
- **6-14** = The Goblins/Guron shiver and are unnerved by the party, and they will get disadvantage on their first attacks on the party.
- **15-above** = The Goblins/Guron are terrified of the party and will retreat back to their tribe, [[Planet/Golarion/Groups/Tribes/Scrap Scrap Tribe/Scrap Scrap Tribe]], never to hunt this path.
