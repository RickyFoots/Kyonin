- The party comes across a *Firbolg* man sitting on the side of the road with a large pipe in hand smoking what smells like some kind of herbal concoction.
- He will ask the party if he can join them and make camp with them.
	- If they agree to let him join them he'll share his herbs around the fire and offer his pipe to everyone there.
- If a party member takes him up on his offer they'll make a constitution roll, if they succeed or fail will determine what they see in the smoke they exhale.

# Constitution 
---
- **DC 10** - If they succeed then they will have a "Good Trip" and everyone else will see their greatest achievement/what they hope to achieve.
	- If they fail then they'll have a "Bad Trip" and everyone else will get to see their greatest fear.
