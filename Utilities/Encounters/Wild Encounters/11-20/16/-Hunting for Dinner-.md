- [[Planet/Golarion/Groups/Hunters and Adventurers/Thuringers/The Thuringers]] ambush the party in an attempt to capture [[Ricochet Whitetail]] and [[Claire Clover]].

- On a failure to see the traps 4 members of the party are randomly caught in bear traps, taking *6(2d4) piercing damage*, and will have to use an action to make a **dexterity or strength check** of **DC 15**, to escape it.
	- [[Player Randomizer]]
- However if they do see the traps then they know their location and can make a **dexterity saving throw** of **DC 15**, to not get caught in them.
- While in the trap the players can't move and every failed attempt at the trap will result in *1d4 piercing damage*.

- If they get caught in the traps or not they will still have to deal with:
	- [[Adina]]
	- [[Dorzu Bafflebell]]
	- [[Drazzol]]
	- [[Lavendea]]
	- [[Tuliphis]]
	- [[Vadolmil]]
