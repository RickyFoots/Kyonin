## Actions
---
- ***Claws*** (<u>Briar Form Only</u>): Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + 1) slashing damage.  
  
- ***Briar Cage***: The dryad magically encases a Large or smaller creature within 60 feet in sharp briars. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (2d8)  piercing damage and be restrained. As an action, a creature may attempt a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity check to free itself of the briars. Doing so causes the creature to take an additional 9 (2d8) piercing damage. The briars can also be destroyed by attacking them. They have AC 10, 10 hit points and resistance to piercing and bludgeoning damage.

## Abilities
---
- ***Shapechange***: The dryad can use her action to change shape to appear as a beautiful female elf. Her statistics don’t change, except that she can’t use her Thorny Body ability and claw attacks in this form. She can change back to her natural briar form at will, using another action.

- ***Innate Spellcasting***: The dryad’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
