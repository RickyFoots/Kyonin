- Most of the Notebook is ruined due to it being trampled on and coated in mud, however there is a small passage just before the last entry that reads:

After studying the void through our various instruments I am drawn to the conclusion that is is composed primarily of energy from [[The Shadowfell]]. Having spent a significant portion of my childhood there I recognize many of the same energies, however they're not identical! It appears that the energies from *The Shadowfell* are mixed with that of the prime elements, which sounds crazy I know, but unless my eyes are playing tricks on me it's the truth!

If these energies ARE mixing then that means that the [[Elemental Spectrum]] as we know it isn't complete, and it also means that there could be another anchor here on [[Kyonin]]. An anchor of Darkness, Shadow, and the void... My mind shudders at the though of someone taking control of this new anchor and using it how they did in [[The Sundering]]... 

I'm _________ to be leaving for ___ and if for what_v_r reason I don't make it then surely _________ found me first... Gods help ___
