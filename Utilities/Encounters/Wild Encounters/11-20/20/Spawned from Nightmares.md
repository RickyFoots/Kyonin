traits:
  - name: Regeneration
    desc: The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.
  - name: Spider Climb
    desc: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
  - name: Shapechanger 
    desc: If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph in to a Tiny bat or a Medium wolf, or back in to its true form. While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
actions:
  - name: Multiattack
    desc: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
  - name: Claws
    desc: Melee Weapon Attack = +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit = 8 (2d4+3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 13).
  - name: Bite
    desc: Melee Weapon Attack = +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., One willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit = 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
