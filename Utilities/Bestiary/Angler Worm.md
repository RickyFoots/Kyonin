traits:
  - name: Spider Climb 
    desc: The worm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings and along its snare lines, without needing an ability check. The angler worm is never restrained by its own or other angler worms’ snare lines.
  - name: Keen Touch
    desc: The angler worm has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on vibrations.
  - name: Transparent Trap
    desc: A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check must be made to spot angler worm snare lines, and the check is always made with disadvantage unless the searcher has some means of overcoming the snares’ invisibility. A creature that enters a space containing angler worm snare lines must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by the sticky snares (escape DC 14). This saving throw is made with disadvantage if the creature was unaware of the snare lines’ presence.
  - name: Silk Snares
    desc: The angler worm burrows into the ceilings of caves and tunnels, where it creates snares from strong silk threads coated with sticky mucus. It then lures prey into its snares while remaining safely hidden itself, emerging only to feed. With dozens of snares, food always comes to the angler worm eventually.
actions:
  - name: Multiattack 
    desc: An angler worm makes one bite attack. It also makes one coil attack against every enemy creature restrained by its threads and within reach of its coils - once it has coiled around one creature it stops coil attacks against others.
  - name: Bite
    desc: Melee Weapon Attack = +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit = 8 (2d4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage.
  - name: Coil
    desc: Melee Weapon Attack = +2 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit = 3 (2d6) acid damage, and the target creature must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled adjacent to the angler worm (if it wasn’t already) and grappled in the angler worm’s coils (escape DC 12). While grappled this way, the creature is restrained by the angler worm (but not by its snare lines), it can’t breathe, and it takes 9 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the angler worm’s turns. A creature that escapes from the angler worm’s coils may need to make an immediate DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being restrained again, if it escapes into a space occupied by more snare lines.
