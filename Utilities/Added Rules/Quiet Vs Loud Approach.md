# Rules to Approaches
---
- When the party enters a "*Raid*" or "*Dungeon*" that is tagged with #Approach/Loud and #Approach/Quiet:
	1. Ask them how they want to *approach* the area and give them the above choices.
		2. **Quiet**: If they chose to do this *quiet* they'll need to <u>each</u> roll *stealth* and will need to beat the *Stealth DC* upon entering the area.
			- For each "*Successful*" roll they'll go up by one on the <u>silence scale</u> and for any "*Crit Success*" they'll go up by 2 <u>to a total of 10</u>.
			- After the roll they'll need to <u>keep up</u> their stealth; For every action they take while in stealth there will be a cost on the scale:
				- *Melee Attack on an armored enemy*: Down by **two**.
				- *Spell with Verbal components*: Down by **one**, unless they successfully roll stealth.
				- *Enemy Screaming*: Down by **four**.
				- *Armored grapple contest*: Down by **one**.
			- If the scale gets down to *Ability Checks* enemies will get to roll to detect the party.
			- Upon making it to the destination *quietly* the party will get the reward for doing so.
		1. **Loud**: This is the standard approach, the party **will not** be punished for taking this approach.
