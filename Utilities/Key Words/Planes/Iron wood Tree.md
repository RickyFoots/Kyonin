- A Fey native tree whose wood is as tough as iron but keeps the malleability of a "Golarion maple" tree which is perfect for bows, ships, homes and other things made of wood.

- Brought to Golarion by the [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Iron Wood Acres/People of Acres/Clover Family]], through their connection to the [[The Feywilds]]
