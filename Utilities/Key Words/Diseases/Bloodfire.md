- Magical viral infection contracted from being scratched, cut, or bit by a being from the [[Elemental plane of Fire]]. 

- The infection sits dormant, untraceable, in the infected for 100's of years and becomes active only when the *Elemental plane of Fire* and [[The Feywilds]] align/eclipse with the [[Materiel Plane]]. 

---
- Symptoms include: Confusion, altered mental status, slurred speech, loss of consciousness, hot and dry skin, steam erupting from the body, seizures, boiling blood, complete body dehydration, and spontaneous combustion.
	- This is one variant of [[Elemental Sepsis]].

- There are no known cures to "Bloodfire", but [[Princess Ilfselhmina]] was infected on the same day as her father, **King Ilfselhmina**, but didn't suffer any negative effects, aside from strong fever.

- [[The Shattered Hand]] believes that the Princess needs to be captured and studied to further his experiments with controlling [[The Elemental Anchors]].
