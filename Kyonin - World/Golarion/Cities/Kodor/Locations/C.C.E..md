1. Typically, the C.C.E. travels the continent of [[Golarion]], going from town to town inviting all that attend the show in their hometown to follow them to the next town as a way of telling a complete story which always ends in Kodor's "Ring above the Rocks" 
2. The central stage,"The Ring above the Rocks", where the final fight takes place is literally in the center of Kodor suspended between all four mesas via cabling. Under which are massive trapeze nets to catch any falling wrestlers.
