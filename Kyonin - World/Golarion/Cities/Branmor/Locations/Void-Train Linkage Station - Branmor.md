1. Grand Maker [[Bromrik Faelgram]] is the head overseer of the Dwarven branch.
2. In Dwarven fashion, the [[Void Portal]] sits just in front of a diverted lava flow that will more than likely be reopened once the portal is fully operational.
3. The main job of the dwarven branch is to create new alloy's that better serve the purpose of "Void Travel", as well as make the majority of the [[Floatstone Rails]] used by the [[Kyonin - World/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/Kodor]] branch, [[The Void-Train workyard]].
