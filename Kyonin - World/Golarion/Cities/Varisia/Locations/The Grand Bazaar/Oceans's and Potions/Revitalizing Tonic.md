1. **Disease be Gone**: This golden, fizzing beverage smells strongly of honey, ginger and sage. 
	- When you drink it, you may *reroll* the *saving throw* to resist a *disease* you are afflicted with, curing yourself on a success. 
	- If the disease doesnâ€™t impose a saving throw, the tonic does nothing. 
	- Drinking this tonic is only effective *once* every *10 days*.
