Constructed of a large upturned ship bow, the church sits on the edge of the [[Arcane Elevator]]s "walking platform" facing [[The Pier]], often times it's the first thing people see of the city. Coincidentally, it's also the first place new members are allowed to go, so that they can meet [[Deacon Trissatra Elmmight]] and get assigned a duty or area of the city to take care of.

1. One of the few churches to [[Shar - Loss]] to exist across [[Kyonin]], since her domain isn't necessarily an actionable one, but most people will pray to Shar at least once in their lifetime.
2. The church acts as both the religious focal point of the city, it's also the only governing body, which makes the Deacon both the religious head of the city and the mayor.
