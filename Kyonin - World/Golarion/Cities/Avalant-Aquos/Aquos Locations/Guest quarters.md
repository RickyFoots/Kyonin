8th floor.

The guest quarters, unlike the rest of [[Aquos]], is very uniform and greatly resembles the shared living spaces of a college. Once you exit the central elevator, you'll be in the "mess hall" with a long communal kitchen top in the back of the room and taking up the center is a four by four of benches broken up by four walking paths in the middle, each of the paths leading left and right lead to a set of doors.

Once out the doors of the mess hall, there is a large trough with sink heads jutting out from the wall that spill into the trough. Just beyond the trough is a doorway that leads to a large empty room with multiple drains in the scattered throughout, as well as shower heads lining the walls. 

Beyond the communal bathrooms are sets of simple rooms on either side of the hallway, each equipped with a small bed a table and a foot chest.
