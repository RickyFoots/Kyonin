The premier magic college of [[Golarion]]. Often referred to as the gem of [[The Republic of Solaris]]. A group of ancient but well maintained cobblestone buildings in the city center, much like the [[Church Of Pelor]], found only a few blocks away, the college buildings are adorned with stained-glass. The stained-glass that decorates the college depict [[Presvaris Spiritsong]], a few nobles that donated to the school, and prefessors that made an impact.
