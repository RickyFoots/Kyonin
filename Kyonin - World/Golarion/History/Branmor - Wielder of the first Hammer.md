Branmor was the first of the dwarves and subsequently their first king. It is said that the god [[Moradin - Crafting]] looked upon the face of [[Kyonin]] and felt great disappointment, as there was nothing being made withing the world except by he and his kin. That disappointment grew to depression and then finally... action. 

Moradin plunged his hand within the world and grabbed a chunk of raw iron, after looking it over, and knowing its faults he breathed life into the iron. His newly awoken "son" awoke with a blood-curdling scream which startled Moradin, so he dropped this new being back into the mountain from which he was plucked. As a result, the mountain was sundered, carving a deep pit within it. Awakening to his new dark and stone-y home, Branmor decided this new home suited him and began to build.

Moradin watched with glee as his new creation ripped unique stones and minerals from the walls of his new home to build tools and gather more resources, but something was missing, and both creator and creation knew it. While Branmor had made a "pick" to mine the stone and an obsidian dagger to fend off anything unsavory living in the stone, he didn't have anything to bend the minerals he collected to his will. Branmor looked to his creator and spoke for the first time, saying just one simple word, "halaur", or gift in the common tongue.

Hearing this, and without thinking, Moradin moved to gather the resources needed to make his creation's boon. Grabbing the heart of a dying star and [[Durumium]] from the center of the [[Elemental plane of Stone]], he brought them to the [[Elemental plane of Fire]] and, using nothing more than his hands and the fire he was engulfed in, forged the very first hammer, [[Luovasara]], or "hammer of creation". 

Proud of this new creation, Moradin whispered the name "Branmor", or iron, and sent it off to its new master. [[Luovasara]] flew down to [[Kyonin]] in a ball of fire and pummeled the stone beneath it with a thunderous crash. Hesitant but trusting Branmor approached, and within the blink of an eye [[Luovasara]] streaked to its new master handle first, until it was but a goats' hair away. Branmor fell backwards on his ass shouting profanities at his gift. After a moment of hesitation he arose, and took his gift into his hand. Power unlike any had ever seen or felt, up until this point, pulsed within him and in that moment he felt clarity. 

For the next couple of years the first ever city was made out of Branmor's hole in the ground and with aid of his hammer and his god he led the first ever people to prosperity. That is, until [[The Cataclysm]].
