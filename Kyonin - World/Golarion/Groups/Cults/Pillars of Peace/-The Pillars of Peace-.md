Cult lead by [[The Shattered Hand]], that believes that the people of [[Kyonin]] are not to be trusted with any magical power after what they experienced in [[The Sundering]].

---
	1. A group that uses clandestine tactics and subterfuge to control the flow and use of magic in [[1. Kodor]].
	2. They often wear cloaks that change colors and blend in with the world around them  and wear masks enchanted with changeling blood to shift their facial features to help blend in with the people of [[1. Kodor]].
	3. While they will sometimes walk among the citizens of [[1. Kodor]] disguised, they prefer to fly or float above the people completely invisible.
	4. They are the secret police of [[1. Kodor]], and will often times freeze those that *The Shattered Hand* has deemed unfit to live in "their" city and whisk them away, either to their base of operations deep within the crust of [[Kyonin - The world]] where they are stripped of their magic and memory, or experimented on.
	5. The only one who travels outside of [[1. Kodor]] is [[The Shattered Hand]], which he does to further his plans of taking control of all four of [["The Elemental Anchors"]] and seizing control of the power of all four elemental planes.
