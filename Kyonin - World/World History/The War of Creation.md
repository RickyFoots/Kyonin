## The Beginning 
---
Creation began with [[Shar - Loss]] in a sea of emptiness beyond all things known as the "[[Lacuna]]". She was not yet the Goddess of Loss, not yet at least, but of *Creation*, and create she did beginning with the foundations, the **Elemental Planes**. First was the [[Elemental plane of Stone]] for it would be the foundation of all, second came the [[Elemental plane of Wind]] to hold the skies, third was the [[Elemental plane of Water]] to hold the deepest depths, and finally came the [[Elemental plane of Fire]] to be the core of all creation. Each of these were joined to the next in a sea of <u>elemental chaos</u>.

With her foundation settled, she began creating four planes, inside the ring of elemental chaos, as well as 7 gods to over see all she had created so far, which would later be called the "*Inner Planes*". After this she began work on her greatest creation, the center of all creation, the [[Materiel Plane]].
- **The First Gods**
	1. [[Chauntea - Agriculture]] - *Stone*
	2. [[Talos - Storms]] - *Wind*
	3. [[Umberlee - The Sea]] - *Water*
	4. [[Pelor - Sun]] - *Fire*
	5. [[Corellon - Fey]] - *Feywild*
	6. [[Sel√ªne - Moon and Dreams]] - *Shadowfell*
	7. [[They Who Came Before - Death]] - *Ethereal*
These "*First Gods*" came into being assigned to their respective planes, and almost immediately began to create beasts and beings to fill those planes each more unique than the last. These creations knew their gods and began worshiping them. Building great monuments to their creators, creating elaborate rituals and even going so far as to sacrifice one another to garner their gods favor. 

## Birth of the Formless 
---
However, these creations were made with a portion of their creators power, which culminated into [[The Weave]]. Slowly as these creations experienced new feelings, thoughts, and phenomena they began to attribute them to <u>new gods</u>, but different groups attributed the same phenomena to different gods which in turn created [[Formless God]]s. Thousands of these gods were created, some buried themselves deep within their respective planes, others took forms to live among the mortals silently, but then there were some that refused to stay <u>formless</u> so they began to challenge the gods that presided of their realms. Taking pot shots here and there, creating cults to worship them, killing off their believers, and even entering the *Lacuna* to challenge them face to face.

These skirmishes began to grow in size, to the point where their reverberations were felt in other planes and even into *Lacuna* proper, eventually grabbing the attention of **Shar** herself. Not wanting her children and her creations to perish, she summoned her children and as many of the "*Formless*" that could be found for a meeting to discuss how best to move forward together.

## Sparks of the Inevitable 
 ---
 Only a few thousand of the "*Formless*" were found, but they quickly came together and decided who among them would lead their side of the conversation. **Pakhet**, [[Kutkh]], and [[Legba]] came to be the voices of the "*Formless*", each representing several of the *Inner Planes*. 

The conversation started peaceful with **Kutkh** taking the lead, asking: 
- "How is it that we find ourselves here in this plane above planes"
**Shar** answered saying: 
- "I brought you all here. Not just in this moment, but it was *I* that brought about these gods." 
Gesturing to her **First Gods**, 
- "Whom *you* attack openly! And it was *I* who built the planes you treat as your own! But these worlds were not built for *you*, for *I* did not build you. So I must ask how it was that you came into being? How is it that you stand before the creator of creators without being known". 
After what felt to be an eons long pause, **Legba** broke the silence:
- "We are but the creations of their creations"
Gesturing to the **First Gods**, after which **Pakhet** finally spoke, or rather thundered:
- "We are what their people believe in! What they pray to in their times of need! They make no mention of *you* or your children! They ask us not of your absence or to 'Pass on a message'! Instead they beg for food, safety, prosperity, and it is not *you* who answer! But us!"
Again a hush filled the void. Unfortunately it wasn't words that broke the silence, but instead the cry of **Pakhet** and the squelch of their "<u>godly essence</u>" splattering onto the crowd as a spear made of burning white flames struck them in their core. The crowd moved as one as they all began inching away from the <u>first dying god</u>, well, all but one. **Pelor**, breaking from the crowd, strode confidently toward his quarry, grinning as he walked.

Strangely enough, the "<u>godly essence</u>" that left **Pakhet** seemed to be absorbed into the forms of the gods that were struck by it, and stranger still, it seemed to want to be absorbed by **Pelor**, because as he approached the essence crawled toward him. What happened next is widely debated among scholars and priest alike. Some say both sides attacked the moment **Pelor** reached the body, others say it was one side that attacked the other first, but one thing that cannot be debated is that the body of **Pakhet** was ripped apart bit by bit and consumed by the fledgling pantheon.
