1. **Gift of the Sea**: The barnacles have a *hit point maximum of 25*. 
	- Whenever you take *bludgeoning*, *piercing*, or *slashing* damage while wearing the armor, the barnacles take the damage instead. 
	- If this damage reduces the barnacles to *0 hit points*, you take any remaining damage. 
	- This barrier takes damage *before temporary hit points* and **does not** benefit from damage *reduction or resistance*. 
	- For every *long rest* that this armor is submerged in water, the barnacles recovers *5 hit points*. 
	- The barnacles **cannot** regain *hit points* by other means.
