# Abilities
---
- This Rosary has *12 pristine* beads which are used to activate it's various abilities, more beads can be "*blessed*" by a cleric or priest of [[Ilmater - Endurance]]
1. **Test of Endurance**: Whenever an enemies attack misses the attuned they can choose to loose (*1d4*) of their *HP total*, which will cause one of the *12 pristine beads* to sharpen like thorns and inject themselves into the attuned.
	- The attuned can choose to do this as many times as they have *pristine beads* on the Rosary.
2. **Shared Suffering**: The attuned can make a *melee spell attack* (*proficiency bonus* + *con modifier*) to any creature within range of them.
	- On a hit the creature takes all of the damage the the attuned has been enduring from the *pristine beads* (the total amount of hp removed by **Test of Endurance**) 
	- After a creature receives this damage the attuned's *HP total* goes back up to it's original value. 
		- *THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE ATTUNED IS HEALED*
3. **Gift of the Tested**: As long as the attuned is suffering through the **Test of Endurance**, and they are reduced to *0 HP*, they may choose to let one of the *pristine beads BREAK* and instead be dropped to *1 HP*.
	- Once a *pristine bead* has been broken it **cannot** be used again, unless the attuned makes a new bead and then has it "*blessed*" by a *priest or cleric* of *Ilmater*.
