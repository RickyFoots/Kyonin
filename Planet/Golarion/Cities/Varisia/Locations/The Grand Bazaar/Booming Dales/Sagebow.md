1. **Sage Wisdom**: This rough-hewn bow is carved from many interlocking pieces of sage wood. 
	-  The sagebow has *3 charges*. 
		- Whenever you draw this bow to make a ranged attack, you can expend *1 charge* to learn a <u>secret</u>. 
			- This secret can be:
				- The location of *one trap or secret door* within *150 feet* of you 
				- The *surface thoughts* of the creature you are attacking
				- The location of any *food or water* within *150 feet* of you
				- A piece of **ancient lore** from the *region* you are in. 
			- Secrets are no longer than a *single sentence*. 
			- If you choose to cancel your attack after learning a secret, you may do so, *ending your action*. 
			- The sagebow regains all spent charges after a long rest.
