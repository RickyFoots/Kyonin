# Abilities

- This iron band is ringed with frost and embedded with milky blue uncut larimar. 
- The hand upon which you wear the ring is pale and ice cold to the touch. 
- The ring has *3 charges*, and it regains all expended charges after a long rest. 
- You can expend 1 charge while wearing the ring to do one of the following options:
	- **Chilling Blow**: When you hit a target with an *unarmed strike* or a *melee weapon attack*, the target takes an *extra 2d6 cold damage* and it must make a *successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw* or it can't take *reactions* and its *speed is halved* until the end of its next turn.
	- **Ice Javelin**: When you take the *Attack action*, if your *ring-wearing hand is free*, you can replace one of the attacks with a special thrown weapon attack. 
		- As part of the attack, you summon a javelin made of ice and throw it at a target that you can see within range, *Thrown (30/120)*. 
		- The ice javelin uses the damage die and weapon properties of a typical javelin, *1d6 piercing*. 
		- *Hit or miss*, the javelin then <u>explodes</u>. 
		- The target of your attack and each creature *within 5 feet* of it must succeed on a *DC 13 Dexterity saving throw* or take *2d6 cold damage*. 
		- If the attack hit, the target has *disadvantage on this saving throw*.
