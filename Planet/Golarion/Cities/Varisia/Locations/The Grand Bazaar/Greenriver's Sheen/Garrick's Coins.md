# Abilities
---
1. **Ricochet Shot**: As a bonus action anyone holding a/the coin(s) can throw it/them anywhere in a *15ft sphere*, where it/they will remain until the end of their turn, regardless of where it is.
	- While in the air any *Long range weapon attack* made at the coin can then be reflected toward anything within the attackers range at a *90Â°* angle from the coin.
	- Hitting the coin counts toward an attacks overall range, so if a target is 60ft away from a coin then the attacker will need 75ft of range.
	- If someone has multiple coins they can all be tossed at the same time, as part of the same *bonus action*.

2. **Heads or Tails**: Once the users turn is over they can roll *1d4* or *1d2* and call evens(*Fortune*) or odds(*Misfortune*), if they called correctly then however many coins were tossed will return to their hand instantly.
