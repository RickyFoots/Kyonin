1. Made almost exclusively out of compact sandstone and drift wood, like the buildings made by the *Yuan Ti* of the southern isles.
2. Only allows "scaled" workers, like dragonborn, lizard folk, and other yuan ti.
3. Created "*Rat Poison*", a <u>heavy</u> alcoholic drink made by mixing heavily diluted *Yuan Ti* venom absinthe lime and bitters.
