The first of its kind. A combination train yard and research facility created by the head of void research [[Dr. Roland Allvar]] at [[Aran Rhikal's College of Artificing]], who is the boss of [[Professor Laurel Kone]], director of R.I.G. maintenance and construction, [[Rylanor]]'s boss.

1. The work yard consists of two connected parts, an indoor section where the rip in [[The Void]] is housed and contained, and an outdoor workshop for everyone working on anything [[Void-Train]] related.
2. The outdoor workshop consists of several different sections ranging from R.I.G. construction and testing area to rail construction and enchanting work yard.
3. The Portal itself has large [[Arcane Sigils]] lined, stone, triangular, portal that is connected to train rails that the actual [[Void-Train]] sits on.
4. The [[Void Portal]] opens and closes at the behest of the Dr. since he is the only one who fully understands how to fully utilize the [[Arcane Sigils]] that are engraved on the portal's frame.
