- The company that invented the first firearm by mixing dwarven steel and goblin fireworks. 
- [[Rylanor]]'s grandfather founded the company, but didn't patent the first design "*So that anyone who was born without magic, or too busy to learn the gobbledygook, could hold his own in a fight*".

- They also own [[Kyonin/Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/Locations/Shops/Arms of Iron]], a good size shop in [[Kyonin/Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/Kodor]] that sells anything from simple palm pistols to the more robust "Bad News".
