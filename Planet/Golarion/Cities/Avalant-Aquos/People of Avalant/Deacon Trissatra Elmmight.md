1. She is in direct contact with [[Planet/Golarion/Groups/Organizations/The Heart of Shar]]'s priest and leader, [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Avalant-Aquos/People of Aquos/Priest Olovandrin]], but acts as the defacto leader for all of their topside operations. (Mainly just the day-to-day goings-on in [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Avalant-Aquos/Avalant]])
2. Uses the sending spell to keep in touch with Olovandrin, who operates in [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Avalant-Aquos/Aquos]], but she hasn't heard anything from him in what feels like weeks, and usually they communicate several times a week.
