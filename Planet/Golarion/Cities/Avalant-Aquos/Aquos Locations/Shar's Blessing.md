5th floor of [[Aquos]].
This floor acts as both the religious and educational center of Aquos. Once you step out of the main elevator, you'll see a split in both architecture and demeanor, on the right side of the floor is a large, multi-story, traditional kind of school. On the left is a massive, jagged, gothic style church with the symbol of [[Shar - Loss]] on its front door.
