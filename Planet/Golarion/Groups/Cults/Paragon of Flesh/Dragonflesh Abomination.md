- A dragonflesh abomination is the final stage of a grafter’s transformation—a hulking monster whose corrupted brain is ablaze with desire for treasure. Its abhorrent transformation erases the last vestiges of its previous life. It sprouts a tail and clumsy wings and grows to enormous size, barely retaining a bipedal shape. Its stomach churns with acid, causing noxious fumes to waft from its mouth and providing it with a caustic breath weapon. Its body is in a constant state of growth and change, allowing it to quickly heal from its wounds.
- These creatures are most often found in abandoned dragon lairs, temples to [[Tiamat - Chromatic Dragons]], or other sites associated with the dragons they love.
