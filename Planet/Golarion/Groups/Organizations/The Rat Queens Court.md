- Based out of [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Varisia/Varisia]]
- *Symbol*: **Knot under a twisted crown**
- The court is run by [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Varisia/People of Varisia/Netch the Drowned]].

---
1. The Rat Queens Court acts as Golarion's *foremost thieves guild*, with footholds in most cites across Golarion.
	- Including:
		- [[Kyonin/Planet/Golarion/Cities/Kodor/Kodor]]
		- [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Branmor/Branmor]]
		- [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Talavon/Talavon]]
		- [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Avalant-Aquos/Avalant]]
2. They operate in accordance with *most* local governments in each of the major cites by smuggling in *illegal or illicit substances*, *people*, and *animals* for the elite and powerful of each city.
3. This seedy group uses **any means necessary** to achieve their goals and is some how intrinsically linked to both [[The Void]] and [[Mask - Thieves]]. 
	- Their connection/ relationship to [[Mask - Thieves]] is very hit or miss, as in some members of the court are very strongly devoted to him and his teachings, while others chalk things up to coincidence and luck.
4. Run [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Varisia/Locations/Bars and Taverns/A Gorgon's Thirst]], the bar just behind [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Varisia/Locations/The Tricky Sphinx Casino]], and the underground fight pit right underneath it, [[Planet/Golarion/Cities/Varisia/Locations/The Snake Pit]].
