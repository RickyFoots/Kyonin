- A guild for all budding adventurers across all of [[Kyonin]]. Originally founded outside [[Golarion]], The Adventurers Guild was originally made so that anyone who could swing a sword would always be able to find work. 

- Every Branch of The Adventurers Guild has 3 basic shops within, a Weapons and Armor shop, a Potions shop, and a General goods shop. More specialty shops can be found in the cities each branch is in.
