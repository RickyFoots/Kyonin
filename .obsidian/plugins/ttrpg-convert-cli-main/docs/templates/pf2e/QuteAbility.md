# QuteAbility

Pf2eTools Ability attributes (`ability2md.txt` or `inline-ability2md.txt`).

Abilities are rendered both standalone and inline (as an admonition block). The default template can render both. It contains some special syntax to handle the inline case.

Use `%%--` to mark the end of the preamble (frontmatter and other leading content only appropriate to the standalone case).

Extension of [Pf2eQuteNote](Pf2eQuteNote.md)

### hasDetails

True if getHasAttributes is true or special is present. In other words, this is true if there is more than just a name and text. Use this to test to choose between a detailed or simple rendering.

### hasEffect
