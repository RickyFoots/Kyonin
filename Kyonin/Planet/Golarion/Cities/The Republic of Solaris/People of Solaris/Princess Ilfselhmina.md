## Abilities
---
- **Cunning Action**: On each of its turns, the thief can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

- **Evasion**: If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a *Dexterity saving throw* to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it *succeeds* on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

- **Sneak Attack** (*1/Turn*): The thief deals an extra (*2d6*) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack *and has advantage* on the attack roll, or when the target is *within 5 feet of an ally* of the thief that isn't incapacitated and the thief doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

- **Rakish Audacity**: She can give herself a bonus to her initiative rolls equal to her Charisma modifier.
	- She also gains an additional way to use her *Sneak Attack*; she doesn't need advantage on the attack roll to use her *Sneak Attack* against a creature if you are within *5ft of it*, no other creatures are within *5ft of her* and she doesn't have disadvantage on the attack.  

- **Fancy Footwork**: During her turn if she makes a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of her turn.
