- Once you exit the main elevator, you'll see a decent sized "park" modeled after Japanese water gardens, with all manner of sea life swimming through little gutters filled with water that weave in and out of the park in the shape of [[Aquos]] crest. 
- Several benches and tables line the outside of the ring.
