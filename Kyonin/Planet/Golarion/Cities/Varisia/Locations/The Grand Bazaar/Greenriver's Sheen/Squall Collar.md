- This cold steel choker is forged into the shape of a roiling storm. 
- It gives you a static shock when touched. 
- It has *3 charges*. 
- While wearing the collar, you can use an *action* and *expend 1 charge* to cast [sleet storm]() (*save DC 15*) from it. 
	- The Squall Collar regains all expended charges after a long rest.  

- *Amplified.* If the [[Squall Caller]] is within 60 feet of this collar, it gains the following properties:  
	- Wearing the collar allows you to see normally through heavily obscured areas caused by weather or spells such as sleet storm or fog cloud.  
	- The saving throw DC for spells cast from the collar increases to 16.  
	- When you are targeted with an attack that deals thunder or lightning damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. 
		- Additionally, the *Squall Caller* deals an *extra 1d8* of the triggering damage type for 1 minute. 
		- Once the collar is used in this way, the ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.
