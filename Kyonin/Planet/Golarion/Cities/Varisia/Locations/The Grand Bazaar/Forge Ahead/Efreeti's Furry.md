	- This AC reduction and extra damage *ends* if *Efreetiâ€™s Fury* moves **more than 60 feet away** from the creature. 
	- Additionally, as a *bonus action* while wielding this sword, you can teleport to an unoccupied space within *5 feet* of a creature that is currently suffering a *penalty to AC due to this weapon*. 
	- A creature is unaffected by the AC penalty if it is **immune** to *fire*.
