- An old, well-worn, and scarred shoulder-length glove with pulsing burgundy and red magical glyphs placed all over the glove in random spots. 
	- The glyphs almost seem to shift and move as if being pulled around by an unknown puppet master, forming different unique shapes. 

- This Legendary Wondrous Item grows with its wielder, gaining more and more power as the wielder goes up in levels and meets the requirements set forth by the glove.
 
---
- **Item Type**: Wondrous item
- **Rarity**: Legendary
- **Requires Attunement**: Yes

**Abilities**: While attuned to the glove you gain the following benefits:
- ***Fire Aura***: As a bonus action, the attuned can call upon the power stored in the glove and activate its fiery aura for the next minute, but won't be able to do so again until they've had a short rest. 
	- <u>Once activated</u>, at the start of each of the attuned's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes *1d4* fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that arenâ€™t being worn or carried ignite. 
- ***Fire Resistance***: The attuned  gains resistance to *fire damage*.
---
**Curse**: The Glove is actually the skinned arm of the previous wielder and is inhabited by a portion of the soul of the [[Archdevil]], [[Zariel, Lord of the First]]. 
- Once the glove is attuned to, the glove itself burns away leaving only a pile of ash and the pungent smell of burnt flesh in the air, after which the *glyphs* that were on the glove bind themselves to the attuned and cannot be removed without the use of a 9th level [Wish](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Wish#content) spell or by severing the limb the binding runes are attached to.
- Zariel will begin to whisper to the attuned and ask for favors, in return she will grant them power (oh, and she won't attempt to take over the body of the attuned), her asks and the rewards for them are as follows:
**Cursed Abilities**:
1. ==**Prerequisite**==: Keep the curse and/or the arm the curse is attached to.
	- [X] ***Forced Conscription***: Any kill made within *60ft* of the attuned will cause the soul of the slain creature to be absorbed into the *glyphs* which will be used for future prerequisites.
		- All souls trapped within the glyphs are at the mercy of *Zariel*, so if any soul is trapped within the glyphs that the attuned wants back they will need to make a deal with *Zariel* first.
2. **==Prerequisite==**: The soul of a creature or humanoid, *at least* a pound of still bleeding flesh, and a weapon.
	- [X] ***Bound Weapon***: The attuned gains the ability to bind a weapon to them, which they will be able to summon as a *bonus action*, by preforming a one-hour ritual with the blood and flesh mentioned above.
3. **==Prerequisite==**: Two souls of a creature or humanoid, one of which <u>needs</u> to be a *Banshee*.
	- [ ] ***Bloodthirsty Battle-cry***: The attuned gains the ability to instill fear into those around them, as an *action* the attuned can make a blood-curdling scream and <u>any creature hostile toward the attuned</u>, within *30ft*,  will need to make a wisdom saving throw equal to *(10 + charisma mod + proficiency bonus)*. On a failed save a creature becomes [Frightened]() of the attuned for a *10 min*, the creature can make saving throws at the end of *each* of it's turns to break the effect, however on a successful save the creature is unaffected and is *immune* to this ability for the next week.
4. **==Prerequisite==**: Four souls of any *humanoid* and the heart of any fire based humanoid or creature (like a phoenix, fire giant, flame elemental, tiefling, or fire based dragonborn or dragon, etc.)
	- [ ] ***Wings of the War Devil***: The attuned gains the wings of their now patron, as a *free* action the attuned sprouts smoldering "angel" wings. The wings last *indefinitely*, but any creature that makes a *DC 10 Int saving throw* knows who gave you those wings. With the wings out the attuned gains a *60ft* flying speed and gains *resistance to cold damage*.
5. **==Prerequisite==**: Eight souls of any *humanoid* and a vial of poison, which the attuned must drink. 
	- [ ] ***Right hand of War***: The attuned gains the ability to curse any creature they are able to touch. The attuned can reach out and make a *melee spell attack* roll *(charisma mod + proficiency bonus)* against a creature, on a hit the creature takes *3d4 necrotic* damage and must make a *DC 15 Con saving throw* or be *poisoned*, *blind*, or *deafened* (*attuned's* choice) for a minute. The afflicted can make the same save at the *start* of each of it's turns to try and break free of the affliction, as an action. 
6. **==Prerequisite==**: Ten souls of any *humanoid* as well as two *greater demon* souls.
	- [ ] ***War Devils aura***: The attuned gains the ability to summon the over powering visage of the war devil herself, as long as all other **Cursed Abilities** and ***Fire Aura*** are active the attuned may use [Zariel's stat block](https://media.wizards.com/2019/dnd/dragon/26/DRA26_Zariel.pdf)
