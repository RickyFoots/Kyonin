- A glowing and pulsating 20 sided polyhedron.

- The "*Heart of the Weave*" is a blasphemous artifact created by [[Servants of the Weave]] that absorbs magic and either seals it away or amplifies the magic cast by a wielder.  
---
- **Location**: On a [[-Shaman's Corpse-]]
- **Item Type**: Wondrous Item 
- **Rarity**: Artifact
- **Requires Attunement**: No

**Abilities**: The *Heart of the Weave* has two forms:
- ***Creation***: While in this form the *Heart of the Weave* amplifies one spell cast by the wielder to the spells highest level, (**9th level**).
	- Once a spell is cast this way it can't do so again until it "*destroys*" a number of spells levels equal to *twice the amount* destroyed the previous time. 
		- The party would need to destroy *15 spell levels* to use it again and then *30 spell levels*, etc.
	- Immediately after a spell is cast through the *Heart of the Weave* the wielder will receive **86** (**8 d12 + 20**) **radiant damage**.
		- If a creature would be **killed this way**, *instead of going to their respective afterlife*, they instead are whisked away to the realm of [[Mystra - Magic]] where they will be judged.

- ***Destruction***: While in this form the *Heart of the Weave* "destroys" all spells that are cast within **40 ft.** of the wielder and all magical items become inert.
	- To activate this form the wielder must cast [Counterspell](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Counterspell#content) or [Dispel Magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spells:Dispel%20Magic#content) through the artifacts **Creation** form, however the negative effects and prerequisites of using the *Creation form are nullified*.
		- This form lasts for *1 min* and can't be used again **until the next dawn**.
	- *Any spell caster that casts a spell within the radius of the wielder* needs to make a **DC 10 Int Saving Throw** or forget the spell they were trying to cast *completely*.
