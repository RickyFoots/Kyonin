The detailing on this ring slowly rearranges itself into myriad patterns.

---
- **Location**: [[The Fothganehr Mine]]
- **Item Type**: Ring/ Wondrous Item
- **Rarity**: Uncommon
- **Requires Attunement**: Yes

**Abilities**: While wearing this ring, you gain the benefit of one Eldritch Invocation from the warlock class. 
- You can choose the invocation the first time you attune to the ring. Your spellcasting ability for the invocation is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you attune). 
	- If the invocation has a prerequisite of any kind, you can choose that invocation only if you're a warlock who meets the prerequisite. 
	- If the invocation grants a spell that requires a warlock spell slot to use, you can cast it once per long rest without expending a spell slot instead.

**Curse**: By attuning to this ring, you have agreed to a minor pact with an otherworldly being. 
- You can only benefit from this ring if you satisfy the whims of your patron, in exchange for their gift. 
- The patron linked to this ring is chosen by the GM or rolled randomly on the table below. 
- You can end attunement to this ring with any spell that can remove curses, which also ends the pact. 
- The gem on your ring reflects the mood of your patron, changing color in response to your actions. Occasionally, the patterning on the ring's surface will arrange itself into writing that explicitly communicates your patron's desires.
- Otherworldly Patrons:
	1. **Demented Devil**: Your devilish patron torments you. Once per day, you have disadvantage on a single ability check, attack, or saving throw (chosen by the GM).
	2. **Fickle Fey**: Your fey patron delights in your fumbles. Whenever you roll an 1 on an attack or Dexterity saving throw, you fall prone.
	3. **Charitable Celestial**: Your celestial patron abhors wicked deeds. You have disadvantage on attacks against good-aligned creatures.
	4. **Leaching Lich**: Your undead patron is leaching your life essence. Whenever you regain hit points from a spell, the amount you regain is halved.
	5. **Greedy Genie**: The genie you serve demands a golden tithe. Each time you finish a long rest, 10 gp from your personal wealth vanishes.
	6. **Ominous Old One**: You are plagued with horrible nightmares. Each time you attempt to take a long rest, you must first succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from the rest.
- Invoker's Bands allow the wearer to draw power from an otherworldly being that either crafted the ring or was bound to it somehow. Be careful, this power often comes with a hidden cost.
