- An ordinary dragonflesh grafter is a hulking fusion of draconic and bipedal characteristics, standing between 8 and 12 feet tall. As its original nature wanes, its draconic powers grow, giving it a thick layer of dragon scale armor that covers the grafted areas of its body. A dragonflesh grafter can belch forth a gout of corrosive acid in a mockery of dragon breath.
- As a universal effect of their experimentation, grafters become obsessed with treasure. Their greed compels them to gather any gold or gems they can. After taking this treasure back to their lairs, they gaze for hours on end at their glittering trinkets and golden baubles.
