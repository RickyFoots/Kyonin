---
- A beautifully decorated and pristine shop with several mannequins and hanging racks depicting all different kinds of clothing.
- Run by an exceedingly large *Goliath* man named [[Garok Bare]] 

### Facts
---
1. This store hates all who enter it equally, the royalty are treated just as poorly as the paupers.
2. Made by *Garok*'s now dead wife *Mary*, who was a very thin and pale *elven* woman, found it very difficult to find clothes that fit her. 
	- She taught herself, and eventually *Garok*, how to sew and create clothes.
	- Unfortunately *Mary* had no talent for making clothes, but *Garok* wore what she made regardless.
