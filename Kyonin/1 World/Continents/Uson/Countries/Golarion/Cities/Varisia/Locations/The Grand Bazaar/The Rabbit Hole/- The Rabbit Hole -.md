---
- A very quaint and "*woodsy*" shop with a ton of live plants growing all over the store and even some growing in the walls of the store.
- Run by an elderly *Harengon* woman named [[Elia Oakfoot]]

### Facts
---
1. A good portion of the [[Varisia]]'s water is diverted here, and the only reason that is allowed is because *Elia* cured [[The Sultan]] of a very "**Dangerous Disease**", he had the flu.
