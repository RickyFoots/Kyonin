# [[Avalant]] - "*Dregs upon the Waves*"
---
- Avalant is a man made city that is directly connected to the underwater city of [[Aquos]] via [[Arcane Elevator]]. 
- The oldest part of the city, and the closest to the arcane elevator, is the best supported because the elevator has a kind of hexagonal "*walking platform*" made of a turquoise pewter stone that the residents built off of. 
- As the community began to grow, they began building off of the original city using mainly repurposed ship parts.
