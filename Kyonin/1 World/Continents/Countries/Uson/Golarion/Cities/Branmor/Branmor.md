# [[Branmor]] - "*Birthplace of the Dwarves*"
---
- Named after the first dwarven king. 
- If you were to look at this city from the plains surrounding the mountain that it's housed within, you'd see nothing more than two massive stone gates in the likeness of [[Kyonin/1 World/Continents/Countries/Uson/Golarion/History/Branmor - Wielder of the first Hammer]] built into the side of a mountain. 
	- Once inside those gates, however, is the bustling metropolis of the dwarves.
