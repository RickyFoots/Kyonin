1. This store hates all who enter it equally, the royalty are treated just as poorly as the paupers.
2. Made by *Garok*'s now dead wife *Mary*, who was a very thin and pale elven woman who found it very difficult to find clothes that fit her so she and *Garok* began making clothes for herself.
	- *Mary* had no talent for making clothes but *Garok* wore what she made regardless.
