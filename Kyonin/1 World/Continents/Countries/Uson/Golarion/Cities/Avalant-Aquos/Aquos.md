# [[Aquos]] - "*City of Second Chances*"
---
- The city buried deep within the sea. 
- A large sunken city found miles below the sea, protected by an alchemists dream, [[Depth Glass]]. 
- Similar in shape to a bee's hive, Aquos is made of *10 layers*, each with its own gimmick that helps its people to survive deep beneath the ocean. 
- Aquos crest consists of two <u>large serpents</u>, one a dark turquoise and the other an emerald green, intertwining with one another to make a circle made of circles.
