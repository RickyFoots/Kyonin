A muted green and blue Simic Hybrid man with shorter wavy tendril like hair on his head, slightly glowing dull green eyes that somehow radiate warmth and understanding. From his shoulders sit a cloak like manta ray "wings" that covers the ceremonial robes of [[The Curch Of Shar]], dark navy blue holy robes with light pink accents, with [[Shar - Loss]]'s symbol across the back and on the lapel, that he always wears.

1. Head of [[The Heart of Shar]], which he himself founded after awaking from his re-creation and subsequently loosing who he was before he was made into a Simic Hybrid.
2. Being one of, if not the last, surviving projects of [[Kyonin/1 World/Continents/Countries/Uson/Golarion/History/The Vast World Project]], Olovandrin, with the help of [[Deacon Trissatra Elmmight]], quietly have been seeking out his brothers and sisters that were made/ re-made alongside him during the "project".
3. In an attempt to reach out and connect with other Simic Hybrids, he cast a modified <u>sending spell</u> that was hijacked by, [[Oghma's Eyes]], and instead contacted a swarm of [[Failed Spawn]] that escaped and were running a muck after the project was "terminated".
