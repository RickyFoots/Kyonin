A project proposed by the Elven nation of #TBD, after the first of the [[The Elemental Anchors]], [[Zaplavit - Water and Ice]], was discovered off its coast. The idea behind the project was fairly simple, to shift the DNA of prisoners and undesirables that were "Just taking up space and wasting the resources of the elven people." After several years of fruitless testing, and the accidental creation of the [[Failed Spawn]], the kingdom disavowed the project. 

- The project was originally headed up by #TBD who later quit after: "The stress of playing at god" became too much for him to handle. 

- Once the project was disavowed, a radical group of scientist quietly kept testing. Unfortunately, they ran out of test subjects and, began to kidnap people that "wouldn't be missed". Throwing caution and morals to the wind, and hundreds of "Failed Spawn" later, the scientists made a break through, the first ever true Simic Hybrid. What made this breakthrough even more astounding was that the blood of the Simic Hybrid showed signs of transmutative properties, which they quickly exploited, creating a [[Simic Virus]]. The virus spread to several coastal cities then deeper inland and eventually traveling from continent to continent, after which it earned the nickname [[Umberlee's Curse]].

- Fearing no stop to this plague, a gathering of world leaders came together to form a plan to combat this extinction event. Unfortunately, the best plan they could come up with was to gather the Simic Hybrids up and burn them alive. Trying to kill the virus and the host in one fell swoop. Using both magic and iron, the infected were gathered up and immolated, 1,000's were killed and what few remained retreated to the sea. 

- Even in the modern day, most Simic Hybrids are feared and shunned by society, but [[Priest Olovandrin]], of [[Aquos]] is doing his best to gather what remains of the Simic people to start their life a new alongside the Triton people from the [[Elemental plane of Water]].
