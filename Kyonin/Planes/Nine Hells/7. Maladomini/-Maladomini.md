- The seventh layer of the [[Nine Hells]] of Baator. 
- It was an endless field of ruined and decaying cities and the center for all the bureaucracy of the Nine Hells.

1. The layer's sky was a shade of black that was reminiscent of venous blood.
2. The landscape was dotted with abandoned cities that served as shelters and hideouts for runaway petitioners, deserters, criminals, and lost creatures from other planes.
3. Between cities, the layer was marked by surface mines, deforested areas, and clogged canals. 
4. Rivers were completely covered in sludge, and some areas contained sentient pieces of polluted matter that reached and grasped before dying from the toxic air. 
5. The few remaining forests were either in a state of rotting or spontaneously combusted. 
6. A black ichor exuded from all matter in the layer.
