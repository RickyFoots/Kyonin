# History
---
- Pix grew up as many changelings do whose parents weren’t ready for the consequences of adhering to a **Fey**, in an orphanage. 
	- Her time there was unremarkable, however, as she ran away at 15 and traveled from place to place, disguising herself as various people, until she settled in the town of **Treeacre**. 
	- There she met *Delic* and *Eden Belle*, as well as their 16-year-old daughter, **Jolene**. 

- Jolene and Pix became fast friends as Pix got a job working at the *general store* the **Belle’s owned**. 
	- Fast friends, grew to best friends, and eventually <u>first loves</u>. 
	- Their happiness was cut short however when *Jolene* fell to an **illness**, forcing her to be confined to a bed for the last year of her life. 
	- During one of their final conversations, Jolene tells Pix, “**I want you to go out there and live for me, okay? Go travel the world, and fall in love…and be happy**.” 
	- After she was laid to rest, Pix did just that. 
	- She took on <u>Jolene’s identity</u> and lived for her.

- A few more years passed as “*Jolene*” traveled from town to town trying to find a place she knew her late friend would love. 
	- That's when she stumbled her way into [[Talavon]], a beautiful little town surrounded by fields and fields of *Larkspur*, *Foxgloves*, *Poppies*, *Hydrangeas* and *Lily of the Valleys*. 
	- She got a job as a barmaid at the local bar, [[The Peaceful Root]], and became very popular with the patrons, including local bureaucrat, [[Travis Buchannan]]. 

- Mr. *Buchannan* was by far the richest man in the region, owning almost all the flower plantations that Talavon was known for. 
	- He was also <u>one of</u> the *most handsome men in town*. 
	- He was not, however, an eligible bachelor in any way. 
	- He was, and still is, married to the woman whose Father owned the rest of the plantations in town, [[Dolly Buchannan]]. 
	- Unfortunately for “*Jolene*” that didn’t stop Mr. *Buchannan* from taking a personal interest in her arrival.

- Their affair was long, hot, steamy, and anything but discreet. 
	- There may have even been mutual love between them there at one point. 
	- But in a moment of weakness Pix showed <u>her true form</u> to *Travis*, and being ever the businessman, Mr. Buchanan aimed to profit off of her. 
	- He enlisted her help with his shady dealings with [[Vrokan]], disguising herself and pickpocketing when needed. 
	- She **reluctantly** helped with every request, but when he <u>drugged</u> her and took *several vials* of her blood one night without consent or conversation, when she awoke she left without a single word. 

- Heartbroken and betrayed, “Jolene” picked up her pieces and traveled around a bit, eventually making it to [[Kodor]] where she has been working at the [[Balding Rodent Inn]] as a bartender.

- Last night, she was hit on by a very persistent "rich boy". 
	- When she said no a few too many times for his liking, he got rough with her. 
	- “Jolene” can very well fend for herself, but before she could do anything, she was “saved” by [[Hawthorne the Hammer]], and in his rescue attempt he <u>fucking punched</u> her in the face, breaking her nose. 
	- The cops came, and now she is sitting in jail, right next to Mr. The Hammer.
