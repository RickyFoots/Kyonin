# History 
---  

1. Ever since he could hold tools, Rylanor was working with his parents in the forge and workshop, doing his best to help the family business. He was intrigued by the things he learned and in wanting to learn more he started to tinker and try new things every moment he got. Before he started college his family invented early firearms by mixing steel pipes with goblin fireworks, years later this discovery would spawn the [[Iron Drake Inc.]], giving his family influence and power. Having the money and power to tinker to his heart's content, he constantly modified anything he could get his hands on, one of those things being a suit of armor. He got an internship with the exploration guild and had created his R.I.G, to power the suit he used fire bolt which made it more of a steam engine. Wanting to make his suit more durable, to see how great he could truly make his suit, he decided to start adventuring to see what he could find to truly bring his passion for modifying and tinkering to its height.
2. Went to school at [[Aran Rhikal's College of Artificing]] and was taught by [[Professor Nysdeth Matguln]].
