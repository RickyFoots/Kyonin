# History 
---
- Claire Clover was the problem child for the clover family, that problem being she was the only child. Claire never really fit in with high society, she was constantly getting into fights, interrupting meetings and getting into places she didn't belong. All that being said, the Clovers had too much riding on the success of their only daughter, as there was no one else to inherit the family business when they passed.

- When Claire was young she had gotten into a large fight with her parents, once again she was refusing to attend her social classes, so her and her father got into a yelling match before she ran out of the multistory mansion and towards the forests that rested on the estate. When she crossed the tree line, the first thing that she saw was a broken arrow. She stopped to investigate, however the yells of her father's voice calling for her sent her back into anger and forced her to keep going. That was when the fateful meeting happened, Claire had just forced her way through a bush into a large clearing when an arrow whizzed past her legs, nearly missing the small rodent that she clearly startled. It was less than a second that another Harengon, with gray fur and a white nose, came running up to her. He was wearing some baggy pants and a matching vest, both looked like something he probably found in an alley, and he was holding a bow with a quiver of arrows attached to his hip.

- All Claire remembered was him yelling in her face, causing her to become so angry she just saw red and threw a swing. Her fist connected with this harengon’s face and laid him flat against the ground. That was the moment she looked down and realized this rabbit was just as young as she was and brought her back to her senses.

- “I am so sorry” Claire Said as she reached down her hand, offering to lift him up to his feet.

- “That's alright” the young rabbit responded, “that was a good swing… for a noble”
  
- Claire winced at the mention of her being a noble, but continued to converse with her acquaintance.

- “I'm [[Ricochet Whitetail]]” the young rabbit said before Claire could say anything in response, “and based on your clothing I'm going to assume you are one of the clovers”

- “Claire Clover, and not by choice”

- The two of them got to talking, she quickly learned that Ricochet was a poor Harengon that was spending his time on their estate in secrecy trying to hunt for his next meal, while he learned that she was a noble born that wanted nothing to do with her family. The beginning of a lifelong friendship.

- Over the course of the next four years, Ricochet would make an effort to constantly go hunting on the clover estate and would continuously meet up with Clair. It was his favorite place to hunt, despite the low amounts of game. Claire on the other hand would always try to bring food to her new friend, despite the fact that he always declined, claiming he “does not need any handouts”.

- As Claire got closer and closer to the age of 18 she began lashing out more and more against her father, training with an axe rather than learning how to be a “lady”. Then her 18th birthday got there and she finally decided she had had enough. That morning when she ran into Ricochet, she had started going on a long rant about how she was done with this life and how she wanted to join him wherever he was going because at least it was better than the clover estate. Ricochet protested at first, he knew the life she had with the clovers would be more secure than anything he got into, but knowing who his friend was he relented. They decided that night she would sneak out, and they would run off together. Later that night, Claire got into a fight with her father and in the heat of the moment she yelled out at him that she was done and leaving forever with her friend Ricochet Whitetail. Hearing this name, her father was clearly shocked and tried to grab her, but she was too quick, too angry. She quickly got out the door with her axe in hand and was ready to join ricochet in the woods.

- Ricochet had no clue what he was getting into bringing Claire into his life. 

- The first couple of months were definitely a time of adjustment for the two new thiefs. Claire had some clear anger issues but whenever they got into a pinch it was those same issues that had saved their tails. Ricochet also wasn't used to working with a partner so they got into these pinches more than he would care to admit. Eventually they realized Claire's anger and Ricky’s deception and range was a perfect combination, she would go in and cause a distraction while Ricky took what he could. In and out without any swords or arrows flying their way. This new found success caused them to gain quite the notoriety and with the new found fame came bigger and bigger jobs.
