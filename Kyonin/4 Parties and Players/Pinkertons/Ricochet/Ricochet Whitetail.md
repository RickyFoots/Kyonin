# History 
---
- Ricochet had no clue what he was getting into, bringing Claire into his life. Ricochet was only a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">year old when his parents had been murdered</mark>, and he was <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">abandoned</mark> on the side of the street. All he knew was a life of petty crime and hunting. 

- Growing up he was taken care of by a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">pair of asshole drunks</mark> that took him in, but as soon as Ricochet could hop, he left, usually resorting to small pocket theft and thievery in order to survive. 

- After an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inspiring encounter with a ranger visiting out of town</mark>, Ricochet stole some schmuck's bow, determined to become the type of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">rabbit</mark> that he had met. 

- Ricochet quickly started training with his bow, but it was impossible to do in the loud town he grew up in, so he quickly traveled to the outskirts. The parts where only the rich and the hopeless live.

- He had easily learned to draw and fire his arrows but was having a hard time aiming against the wildlife. After traveling into the woods one day nearing the point of starvation, Ricky had seen his prey, a small rodent just inside the tree line. He drew back his arrow and fired. Miss. His arrow had hit the large stone behind the rodent and snapped.

- “Crap, only 4 left” he thought.

- He had jumped into a tree and was following the small rodent, waiting for the perfect time to strike so he wouldn't waste another arrow. Due to the wind between his ears from jumping and the intense focus he had on this small rodent he had missed the noise of yelling in the distance. Finally the Rodent had stopped moving just next to a bush.

- “Now's my time to strike,” he thought.

- Ricochet pulled back his arrow and lined it up just right in order to hit his target. Just as the arrow had released a young Harengon girl had jumped from the bush in anger, scaring the rodent, and barely avoiding the arrow between her legs. She was solid white, and clearly in noble clothes, must be a clover. Ricochet was pissed, mainly because of the starvation so he jumped down from the tree, dashed into her face and started screaming.

- HOW DARE YOU, THAT WAS MY FOOD AND HERE IS SOME SPOILED NOBLE…..”

- The next thing Ricochet remembers is pain and being on the ground, she must have punched him. That punch is exactly what he needed to regain his focus and composure though. Ricochet jumped up and took in the young bunny in front of him. She was roughed up, mud all over the noble clothes she was wearing and her ears were a mess. He finally said something.

- Now ten years later Ricky is trying to decide if saying something then was worth it, here he is taking her from her luxury life into a life of crime. Ricky had started stealing more and more and became a much better hunter but there's no way he was comfortable with [[Claire Clover]] joining him in this life, yet here he was.

- The first couple of months were definitely a time of adjustment for the two new thiefs. Claire had some clear anger issues but whenever they got into a pinch it was those same issues that had saved their tails. Ricochet also wasn't used to working with a partner so they got into these pinches more than he would care to admit. Eventually they realized Claire's anger and Ricky’s deception and range was a perfect combination, she would go in and cause a distraction while Ricky took what he could. In and out without any swords or arrows flying their way. This new found success caused them to gain quite the notoriety and with the new found fame came bigger and bigger jobs.
