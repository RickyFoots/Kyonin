[[Ideas to Flesh Out]]
# Ideas 
1. "**The Necropolis**".
	- `Notes`: I've been thinking that *if* this is going to be a part of **Golarion**, it should be buried deep beneath the "**Cursed Sea Islands**"
		- I think that maybe the *Formless God* that was cast into this part of the world had nothing to do with Death or Necrosis. But because they are cursed (<u>or driven mad</u>) their tainted godly magic seeps into the stones of the sunken city causing the dead to rise and seek out {What ever the *Formless Gods* power is} 
2. The "**Cursed Sea**" in the bottom left part of the **Golarion** map.
	- `Notes`: I was inspired to build this because of dredge, [the game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1562430/DREDGE/), but now that we're like a year, and some change, into doing nothing with it I think it should be related to "**The Necropolis**". 		
	- I want there to be an ancient [[Formless God]] that was struck down and caused the landmass that was there to fracture into those of islands, and still be there quietly wreaking havoc on the local populous. 		
	- Maybe the *Formless God* isn't "Sea themed", but has barnacles encroaching on their body or some other way to showcase that their being worn down by the sea.  			
	- *Formless God* of light maybe? ✓	
		- Driven mad by lack of light? ✓
		- Maybe have a few "*Influenced*" Cities/Towns/Villages that worship the *Formless God* against their will.
		- Do I have too many Cults??
3. [[The Demon Seed]] 	
	- `Notes`: The "Gene Seed", created by [[Garyx - Chaos]], that holds the genetic code for all **Demons** 
4. Great houses of [[The Republic of Solaris]] 	
	- `Notes`: **Traitors to the Houses**: *Discovered* traitors of the great houses are quietly killed and then have their spirits bound to a **talisman** held by either the head of the house or someone they deem worthy to control the dead. 		
		- [[They Who Walked Away]] retain their abilities but completely controlled by whoever holds their **talisman**.
		- *They Who Walked Away* still have physical bodies and can speak but their bodies have [[Arcane Sigils]] all over them. 
			- They cover the *sigils* with long sleeves, shirt collars, and floor length skirts/dresses and pants.
1. Make [[Asmodeus]] an old forgotten *Formless God*
	- `Notes`: This would mean that all *devilkind* has some form of divinity buried deep within their heritage.
	- Maybe make it where *Asmodeus* is/was the reason that the *Formless Gods* fell in [[The War of Creation]]
