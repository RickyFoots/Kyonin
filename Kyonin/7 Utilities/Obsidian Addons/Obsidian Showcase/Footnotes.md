## [Footnotes](https://help.obsidian.md/syntax)

You can add footnotes[^1] to your notes using the following syntax:

```md
This is a simple footnote[^1].

[^1]: This is the referenced text.
[^2]: Add 2 spaces at the start of each new line.
  This lets you write footnotes that span multiple lines.
[^note]: Named footnotes still appear as numbers, but can make it easier to identify and link references.
```

You can also inline footnotes in a sentence. Note that the caret goes outside the brackets.

```md
You can also use inline footnotes. ^[This is an inline footnote.]
```

>[!note]

Inline footnotes only work in reading view, not in Live Preview.

[^1]: This is a footnote
