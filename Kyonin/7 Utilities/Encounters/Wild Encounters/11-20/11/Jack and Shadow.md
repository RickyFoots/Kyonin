## Abilities
---
- **Cunning Action**: On each of its turns, the thief can use a bonus action to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

- **Evasion**: If the thief is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a *Dexterity saving throw* to take only half damage, the thief instead takes no damage if it *succeeds* on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

- **Sneak Attack** (*1/Turn*): The thief deals an extra (*5d6*) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack *and has advantage* on the attack roll, or when the target is *within 5 feet of an ally* of the thief that isn't incapacitated and the thief doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

- **Blend into Shadow**: *JaS* have the ability to meld into the shadows of other creatures.
	- As a bonus action *JaS* meld into the shadow that they are touching and can remain there indefinitely, unless they release this ability as another bonus action.

- **Hidden in Plain Sight**: *JaS* can cast the [Disguise Self]() spell at will but only on themselves and any form of *Daylight* will break through the spell.

- **Marked by Shadow**: *JaS* can cover any space it can see within *60ft* in a 10ft by 10ft shadowy cube,  and any form of *Daylight* will break through this ability.

### Reactions
---
- **Strength Drain**: If ever *Jack* is killed and *Shadow* is "Equipped" by another creature the following will take place:
	- The wearer will take (*2d6 + 2*) necrotic damage, and the target's *Strength score is reduced by 1d4*. 
	- The target **dies** if this reduces its *Strength to 0*. 
	- Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target *finishes a short or long rest*.
- If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from the corpse *1d4* hours later.
