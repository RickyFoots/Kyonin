- The party will make camp the same as always but instead of going through their normal routine they will need to make a Constitution Saving Throw in order to stay awake.

- Once asleep, the party will awaken in a pitch black coffin, somewhere high in the mountains, remembering nothing except their names and that the people around them are their friends and party members.

- While walking around village they'll discover that the village consists of several families and an elder.
	- After introductions and some light conversation the spawn will arrive and begin rushing the party.

- 15 [[Spawned from Nightmares]]

- During combat when *the spawned* heal, at the start of their turn, the towns people will start wailing and screaming as the damage dealt to the spawn is dealt to them instead.

- If the party gives up and allows the spawned to kill them they'll awaken with [[A token of a test passed]] lying in the middle of the camp remembering nothing of the dream.
	- If the try to fight *the spawned* and end up taking several folks lives in the process then they'll awaken with one point of exhaustion and the memory of the dream will be seared into their minds 

# Constitution Saving Throw

	- On a failed save they'll instantly fall asleep
