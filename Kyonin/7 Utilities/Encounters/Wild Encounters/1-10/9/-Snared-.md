- As the second watch for the night begins the player/s that are on watch will hear a "Young voice" calling for help not too far from the camp, *like 30 seconds*.
	1. If they investigate they'll see what appears to be a young elven boy with his leg caught in a bear trap.
	2. If they get close to the boy they'll need to make *dexterity saving throws* and then the bandits will attack.

- 5 [[Bandits For 9]] and [[Shedahk of the Court]] 

# Arcana/Perception/Investigation
---
- **DC 15** = There's something about the boy and the trap that isn't quite right 
	- If a player picks *Investigation* the hidden bandits will spring their trap.

# Dexterity Saving Throw
---
- **DC 10** = If failed then the player will take *(2d4) piercing damage* and won't be able to move until the trap is off.
	- Anyone caught in the trap can repeat the save on their turns *at the cost of an action*.
