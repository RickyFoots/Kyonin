# Passive Perception
---
- **1-9** = The sky looks like it's turning a deep shade of gray green.
- **10-15** = After a while they begin to notice that a funnel is reaching for the ground. 

# Nature, Time till Landing = 10 turns
---
- **1-5** = They definitely have at least an hour or two before any kind of bad weather hits. 
- **6-10** = Oh we should definitely find shelter soon, they probably have 15 minutes.
- **11-16** = The tornado is going to hit very soon and finding shelter needs to be the *Top Priority*.
- **17-Above** = There appears to be a small cave *50 ft* from the party in the opposite direction.

# Tornado Stages
---
1. **Strong Wind**: A strong wind imposes *disadvantage* on *ranged weapon attack rolls* and *Wisdom (Perception) checks* that *rely on hearing*.
	- A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. 
		- A *flying creature* in a strong wind *must land at the end of its turn* or **fall**.
2. **In the Storm**: A creature must make a *DC 13 Dexterity saving throw* the first time on a turn that it enters the tornado or that the tornado enters its space, including when the tornado first appears. 
	- A creature takes **10d6 bludgeoning damage** on a *failed save*, or *half as much damage on a successful one*. 
	- In addition, a *Large or smaller* creature that *fails the save* must *succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw* or become [restrained](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Conditions#toc_12) in the tornado until the next turn.
