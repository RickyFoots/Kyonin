An Ivory and Ebony capped pen, laced with golden runes, and an inky black crystal as the nib of the pen.
The Ivory and Ebony swirl and dance across the surface of the pen, almost competing to be the dominant color of the pen.

**Abilities**: This pen creates a link between multiple pieces of parchment that it's nib touches. While linked in this way, anything written on one parchment will be written on the rest of them. Once the wielder of this item says the keyword, "Done", the link between each piece of parchment will be severed and will need to be re-linked in order to have the same affect.
