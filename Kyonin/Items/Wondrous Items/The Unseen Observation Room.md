# Abilities
---
1. **Pass through Reality**: When the wielder says the "*Activation Phrase*" the cube instantly expands into a *10ft by 10ft* cube, the wielder and anyone or anything else within range are instantly transported to [[Ethereal Plane]] where all things, except for ghosts and other creatures that live in *Ethereal Space*, will pass trough them harmlessly.
	- The cube remains large for an *hour* or until it's reverted, by reusing the "*Activation Phrase*" again.
	- Once used the Cube can't be used again unless *spell slots = to 7th level or higher* are "given" to the cube.
	 - While in *Ethereal Space* anyone or anything within the cube can see and hear everything that's going on in the plane they were once in.
