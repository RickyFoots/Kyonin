- The party walks into a dark forest while traveling along the road, and strange noises begin to emanate from deep within the woods. 
# Perception
---
- **2-5** = A rough clearing containing the rotting flesh of a massive deer, and multiple unfortunate hunters, hung from tree to tree. 
- **6-16** = In the center of the clearing, the players will find decimated hyena carcasses and bones laid out around a stone pergola near the hanging carcasses. 
- **17-Above** = The party is not alone, a group of (**1d4 + 3**) [[Gnolls]] lead by a [[Fang of Yeenoghu ]] are hunting the party.

# Religion
---
- **2-7** = This looks like a place of dark demonic worship.
- **8-16** = It looks like some sort of ceremonial space for [[Gnolls]]. 
- **17-Above** = These seem to be for prayers to [[Yeenoghu]].
