- As the party continues on their journey, they hear the soft rustling coming from up ahead. 
	- A [[Bear Cub]] leaps out of the brush screaming and crying and is in a great hurry.

- After the *Bear Cub* either runs off or is caught, the party will have (1d4) minutes before "[[Mama Bear]]" will appear, screaming and whaling while it's fore legs and head are aflame, and attack the party. 

# Finding Baby Bear
## Dexterity Saving Throw
---
- **DC 10** = If the player that's investigating the rusting doesn't meet the save then they're knocked prone and take (2d4+4) damage from the fleeing *Bear Cub*.
	- However if they make the save they leap out of the way and take no damage.

# Catching Baby Bear
## Slight of Hand
---
- **DC 18** = The player catches the bear and has it grappled, but is unable to lift it.
	- *Baby Bear* will try to wriggle free *3 times* before giving up **DC 15**.

## Animal Handling
---
- **DC 25** = The Player convinces the *Bear Cub* that they are friendly and will protect the bear from what it's fleeing from.

## Strength
---
- **DC 12** = The *Bear Cub* is grappled and lifted off the ground but it's fear has gotten worse and will try to break free.
	- *Baby Bear* will try to wriggle free *6 times* before giving up **DC 10**.

# Mama Bear 
## Passive Perception 
---
- **DC 10** or **DC 14**(if the focus is still on the *Bear Cub*) = If someone succeeds they'll hear *Mama Bear* coming and won't be surprised.
	- If they all fail *Mama Bear* gets a **Surprise Round** and the *Bear Cub* gets another opportunity to escape.
