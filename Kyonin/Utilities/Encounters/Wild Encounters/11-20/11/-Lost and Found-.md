- As the party begins to fall asleep for the night they will make their Perception checks as normal, however this check will also be to see a partnered shadow and petty thief, [[Jack and Shadow]], that have been trailing the party and stealing from them late at night.
	- During the day *JaS* will be hiding in one of the players shadows, which will have a much darker appearance to it than the rest of the party. 

# Perception (Late at Night)
---
- **DC 20** = One of the party members will catch *JaS* stealing from another member but instead of seeing *JaS*'s true form the'll instead see another one of their party members.
- **DC 30** = The party member will discover *JaS* disguised as one of their party members but they'll be able to tell that this is an illusion.

# Investigation (Only if Caught)
---
- **DC 18** = The party member that discovers *JaS* stealing will be able to tell that the party member they're masquerading as is covered in deep shadow to make it look like they're not there.

# Passive/Perception (Day Time)
---
- **DC 15** = If someone in the party has a *Passive Perception* that meets or beats the DC they'll discover that one of the party members shadows is much darker than the rest
	- However if they actively are searching for it they'll see that the shadow also has a second delay to it's movement.
