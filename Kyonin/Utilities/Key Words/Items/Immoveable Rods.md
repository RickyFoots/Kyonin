This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an [Action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dybbuk#h-Action) to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an [Action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dybbuk#h-Action) to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying [Gravity](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ashandri%20and%20the%20Braythian%20Void#h-Gravity). The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an [Action](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Dybbuk#h-Action) to make a DC 30 [Strength](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Ability%20Scores#h-Strength) check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.
