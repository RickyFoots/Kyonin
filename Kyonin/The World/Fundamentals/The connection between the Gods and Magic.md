## Basics
After [[The War of Creation]] was settled, so too did the "*magic*" of the cosmology. It was discover by #Todo  that all magic came together to form a kind of lattice, which became known as [[The Weave]]. This lattice winds itself through **ALL** things, connecting all of creation to one another.

*The Weave* is why some people have the ability to strengthen themselves beyond what was thought natural by simply being angry, or why others are able to manipulate the elements with nothing more than a common lute. But what is *The Weave* truly?

### Pioneers
Well it was the first mortal with the power over song, #Todo , that discovered that *The Weave* responds to both tone and rhythm, so invoking them would allow someone manipulate it. Unfortunately that pioneer into the world of magic didn't last long, as with all who claim the title of #Classes/Bard enough is never enough. So it was that their experimentation with *The Weave* lead to a rather potent song that cut out a section of the [[Materiel Plane]], that has yet to have been rediscovered.

After #Todo 's discovery other scholar's began looking at ways to manipulate *The Weave*. In so doing individuals emerged with the ability to manipulate *The Weave* in different and unexpected ways, which lead #Todo to write the novel "`~The Categorization of Those who would play God~`" or simply **Those with the power of Gods: A categorization of 'The Class system'**. A quick summarization of the Novel:
