**The Frozen Prince**

- The lord of [[-Stygia]], and possibly the most hated of the [[Archdevil]]s in the Nine Hells.
- The self-titled "prince" was known for his treachery and was imprisoned in an ancient iceberg, often referred to as his tomb.

#### Description
---
- Levistus's true appearance was widely unknown, as from the outside of his glacial prison he could only be seen as a small black blot a quarter-mile within the mountain of dark ice. 
- The ice was also transparently blue enough that onlookers could perceive his frustrated posture from any angle. 
- On close inspection, Levistus appeared to be a 6 ft (1.8 m) tall humanoid male with dark hair, a neat goatee and an extremely pale complexion, but would be able pass for a human if not for his traditionally fiendish traits; his pointed teeth and coal-black eyes that practically radiated darkness. 
- In the days of his freedom, he wore loose, silken clothing and carried a shining rapier, now donning fanciful garments and other finery when meeting mortals in projected form. 
- When appearing as an aspect, the air around him was chilling and his clothes were always partially frozen and dripping with water.
