# [[Asmodeus]] - **The Cloven**, **Lord of the Ninth**, **Lord of Lies**
---
- *Asmodei* in Infernal, was the [[Formless God]] of <u>indulgence</u> and a patron of oppression and power. 
- The greatest devil and ruler of all *devilkind*, the **Lord of the Ninth** was overlord of all the Nine Hells. 
- From his throne at the bottom of *Baator* the **Lord of Lies** reigned over his kingdom of unyielding tyranny, ceaseless warfare and political intrigue and enacted his diabolical plans to become not only the <u>Supreme Master of the Nine Hells</u>, but to ascend to *Godhood*.

## Description
---
- *Asmodeus's* true form was that of a scaled serpent hundreds of miles long, his acid-black blood, a substance beyond foul, exuding from eons-old wounds. 
- His form's sheer size made it impossible for him to meet and enter into conversations with others, and so he created humanoid-looking avatars. 
- He never showed himself except through avatars or highly advanced project image spells, both in humanoid forms.
- An avatar of *Asmodeus* was handsome, charismatic and captivating on the surface, appearing as a slim, red-skinned humanoid over *13 feet (4 meters)* tall with a horned head, glowing red eyes and a perfectly trimmed beard. 
- He wore red and black clothing valuable enough to cover the annual spending of any nation, but underneath these expensive garments his body was wracked with bleeding injuries he was seemingly unconcerned by.
