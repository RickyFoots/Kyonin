- The ninth and deepest layer of the [[Nine Hells]] of Baator.

---
1. The layer was a featureless plain with jagged edges that extended 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) from east to west and 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from north to south, floating in an endless red void. 
2. The plains were scarred by chasms and ravines several thousand miles deep, and were frequently ravaged by fiery storm winds.
3. The River Styx trickled down into *Nessus* through a little-known, small offshoot. 
4. It was heavily guarded by devils who slew any unauthorized visitors on sight. 
5. The river drained into a shallow pool known as the Forgotten Lake, then continued at the bottom of some of the crevasses before percolating through the rock and ground.
