**Archdevil of Contradictions**

- The lord of [[-Cania]] and most powerful [[Archdevil]] next to [[Asmodeus]] himself. 
- Hell's greatest wizard was a walking contradiction, on the surface the cool and calculating Cold Lord and beneath that the grandiose and hot-headed Lord of Hellfire.

#### Description
---
- *Mephistopheles* played up his infernal image as much as possible, intentionally appearing as the classic archetype of a diabolical devil. 
- He was *9 ft (2.7 m)* tall and striking, his handsome visage and charming yet unnerving smile of self-superiority contrasted by his more monstrous features. 
- His fiendish claws, bright, crimson red skin, large, bat-like wings and impressive, curling ram horns all left his hellish heritage on proud display. 
- Another source of contrast was his dead-white eyes against his long, straight, black hair, as well as his dramatic, flowing cape as dark as the deepest void.

- Earlier reports of *Mephistopheles* claimed that he once had an image more befitting of Cania. 
- He had blue-black skin across his heavily muscled body; wings, horns, and claws a deep shade of blue, scales of sooty black, and eyes that were pale blue except for the red irises and pupils.

- When *Mephistopheles* was donning his *Molikroth* persona, he appeared as an obese man whose gross levels of fatness were frankly absurd. 
- Despite being only *7 ft (2.1 m)* tall he was still massive because he was wider than he was long, competing with creatures like hill giants in terms of sheer mass. 
- Even when the waddling baron was swathed in clothes made from only the most ridiculously expensive materials that were the height of fashion styles, all his foppish finery couldn't hide his ultimately foolish appearance
