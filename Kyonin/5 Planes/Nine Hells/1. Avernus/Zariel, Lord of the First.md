**The Archduchess of Avernus** and the **Lord of the First**

- Was the [[Archdevil]] ruler of [[-Avernus]] who was dedicated to winning the unending [[The Blood War]] between devils and demons. 
- She was originally an angel of the Heavens before transforming into an Archdevil and falling to the [[Nine Hells]].

#### Description
---
- Zariel's original form was that of a beautiful solar with flawless skin, gold-feathered wings, and a blindfold covering her eyes.

- After her descent, she took on a more diabolical appearance: a halo of fire burned atop her head, her once-fine skin was scorched, and her angelic wings, ruined by flame, turned leathery. 
- Her blindfold was abandoned, fully revealing eyes that glowed with white-hot rage, and she had lost one of her hands and replaced it with a flail.

#### History
---
1. Worked with [[Primus]] to create the "*Perfect Soldier*" in the early days of [[The Blood War]]. This lead to the creation of the **Modrons**, which *Zariel* saw as worthless, as well as <u>100</u> [[Cor Bellum]], which were made to be their final work. Unfortunately they were never completed. One of the [[Tanar'ri]] generals learned of their plans and lead an invasion into [[Mechanus]] to thwart them.
