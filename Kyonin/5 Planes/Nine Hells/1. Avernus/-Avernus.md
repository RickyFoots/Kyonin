- The first layer of the [[Nine Hells]] of Baator. 
- The most likely beachhead for any attack by demon-kind, it was the primary battleground of the [[The Blood War]]: legions of devils marched across its plains in continual readiness to repel the hordes of demon invaders.
- Ruled over by [[Zariel, Lord of the First]]

1. Avernus is the largest layer of Baator and one of the most traditionally infernal.
2. A blasted hellscape in the most literal sense filled with rivers of lava, barren hills, and low, rocky mountains as far as the eye could see. 
3. To scale the mountains or move too quickly was unwise at best, since obsidian, quartz, and other crystals jutted from the jagged land, cutting clothes and slicing flesh.
4. The ubiquitous presence of rocks and boulders, some of which seemed to resemble tormented faces and shapes of creatures, rendered the terrain extremely treacherous and difficult to cross at any pace quicker than a fast walk. 
5. Rubble covered the vast, ashen plains of Avernus's charred wastes.
