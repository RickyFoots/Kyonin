**Archduchess Fierna**

- The lady of [[-Phlegethos]] who, along with [[Belial]], were the only archdevils allowed to share rulership over one of the Nine Hells by [[Asmodeus]]. 

#### Description
---
- Fierna appeared to be an incredibly attractive young woman, a lithe, statuesque, *6 ft (1.8 m)* seductress of stunning physique. 
- Tall, dark and sensual, her garments were as royally fine as they were scantily clingy, furthering her image as a being of perversion and indecency.
- Giving away her infernal heritage were the small pair of horns that emerged under her hairline, and even then the fiendish features somehow managed to enhance her enchanting appearance. 
- Her red eyes shined and smoldered like fires were dancing within them and implicit promises of pleasure could be gleaned from her gaze.
