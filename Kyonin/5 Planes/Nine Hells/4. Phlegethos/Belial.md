**Lord of Pain and Suffering**

- The lord of [[-Phlegethos]] who, along with [[Fierna]], were the only archdevils allowed to share rulership over one of the Nine Hells by [[Asmodeus]]. 
- Belial was the veteran schemer contributing diabolical deviousness and greater conspiratorial experience.

#### Description
---
- Belial was the most handsome of the archdevils, appearing as an impressively built, 10 ft (3 m) tall figure of masculine beauty. 
- He was tall, dark and sensual, practically oozing carnality through the regal garments that clung to his body in such a way as to promise pleasure and further his libidinous image. 
- Before [[Mephistopheles]] took on a more infernal appearance, Belial was also the most devilish looking Lord of the Nine, an impression enhanced by the ranseur he always held in his claws. 
- Some said his skin was scaly and ash-black while others purported it was red, and early reports claimed he had a glossy black tail and wings. 
- Other signs of his hellishness could be seen in the small horns, the same black as his tail and wings, that emerged under his hairline, and his large, slanted eyes that glowed and smoldered red with lustful intent. 
- His monstrous features however did little if any to detract from his aura of civility and overall mesmerizing physique.
