- The fourth layer of the Nine Hells. 
- A blazing desolation of fire and lava.

1. The layer's climate resembled the [[Elemental plane of Fire]]. 
2. It was dominated by a scorching heat that ignited the air itself, creating seemingly sentient and aggressive flames that leapt at visitors but not at the residents. 
3. The ground had fissures that spewed jets of flame that flowed into rivers of liquid fire. 
4. It contained numerous volcanoes whose eruptive products flowed through rivers of lava into an incandescent ocean of magma.
