**Triel the Fallen**

- Formerly an aasimon known as Triel
- Most infamous archdevil next to [[Asmodeus]] himself. 
- He was known as the *Lord of the Flies* because his webs of intrigue were so tightly woven that not even flies could escape, but the form he was cursed with by *Asmodeus* earned him a new title; The Slug Archduke. 
- Eventually he managed to overcome this wretched state and return to his previous glory, and if only to retain it, had never told a lie to his kin since.

#### Description
---
- Triel was once renowned as among one of the most beauteous denizens of Celestia but was physically altered after his corruption. 

- His new form was that of a 12 ft (3.7 m) tall humanoid with shimmering, sable skin and the jittering, compound eyes of a fly. 
- Still angelically stunning even after his fall from grace, *Asmodeus* put a curse upon him as punishment for a later crime, forcing him into an even more demeaning form.

- The former celestial's mutated form was that of a 25 ft (7.6 m) tall slug, a grotesque abomination infamously unpleasant even to other devils.
- The Lord of the Flies was constantly surrounded by swarms of the buzzing, scuttling creatures that earned him his title. 
- His body glistened with mucus and thanks to his curse, fecal matter and other rancid filth manifested in piles wherever he went, resulting in his notoriously noxious stench.
- His deformed arms rested at his front and were more comparable to prehensile tails in functionality.
- Replacing his handsome visage was a gross, human-like face with torpid lips, incapable of properly pronouncing words without a slimy, wet lisp.

- However, even when reduced to such an unsightly state, faint glimpses of the Slug Archduke's previously glorious appearance could still be made out. 
- He had recently managed to work off his punishment, partially freeing him from *Asmodeus's* curse and allowing him to return to his humanoid form.
